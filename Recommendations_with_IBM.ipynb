Some articles have the same id, and likely truly are repeats, and can be dropped in the next step below, where we find and deal with repeat ids. NaN's likely aren't repeats, but for ease of analysis later, we'll replace their `doc_description` with a copy of their `doc_full_name`. For NLP purposes, this seems like a resonable decision. 907, 835, 893, 161, 800, 1035, 252, and 492 deserve a closer look to see if they're repeats and should be combined."
